"""
    This module takes an input string and generates a .txt that can then be used in client.py
    to be sent.
    The chosen encoding scheme is the one from exercise 3 in the theory :
    1) we encode each character in the string as a 6 bit binary number, then we concatenate all the binary numbers.
    2) we split this long binary number into l-bit chunks, l is arbitrary (optimal l is to be computed analytically).
    3) we convert each l-bit chunk into a decimal number, that will be the index of the codeword in the codebook for the chunks.
    4) we save the decimal numbers in a .txt file.
    Note : the codebook is generated in the function generate_codebook.
    That way, we have generated a n/l dimension vector that can be sent to the server.
